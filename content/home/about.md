# About

Welcome to RPI Game Dev Club! We’re a group of students who love playing, designing, and most importantly, making games. Week seek to provide tools and resources for beginners and veterans in game development and always encourage showing off your latest accomplishments, big or small.

Every Wednesday we meet to show off work and experiment with different design practices in games.

Saturdays we get into the nitty gritty and learn new technical skills either through our various workshops or exhausting ourselves during a 24 hour game jam.

New or experienced, artist or programmer, you’ll always have something new to learn so you can make great games.
